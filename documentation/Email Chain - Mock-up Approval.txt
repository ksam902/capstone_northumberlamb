Hi Brenda,

As part of our course, we need sign offs on each deliverable. I know we
agreed upon the design mock-ups and changes in our meeting yesterday, but,
we are also required to have some form of approvals documented. This can be
done as easily as sending an email. We just need to have something to show
that the deliverable has been approved.

All we will need from you is a reply stating that you approve of the design
mock-ups.

Thanks,

Chris & Kyle

Hi Chris, I could meet this afternoon. I am so very sorry for all the
confusion and email issues. Would 2pm work? If not, what time is best for
you?

Oh my goodness!!!! Three hundred and eighty-seven emails just popped into my

Seaside was having server issues but I was not warned of this problem... I
am so sorry.
Did you get the email I sent on Friday am (sent from my blackberry) (Now the
email count is up to 401! ) Once I go through all the emails from you I will
get back to you. Perhaps you have suggested another date.
I am so sorry!

Hi Brenda,

That lamb chart does look far better than the previous one. We should be
able to work with that.

It sounds like we are going to get even more snow tonight. Hopefully it will
be cleared up by the afternoon tomorrow and we can meet. We will have to
wait and see what the conditions are like tomorrow before we can confirm the
meeting.

Regards,

Chris & Kyle

Hi Chris, Here is a lamb cut chart to replace the poor quality one I
forwarded last week.

Hi Brenda,

I received two photos of the four you tried to send yesterday.

The campus is closed today due to the weather so we will have to reschedule
a meeting. Are you available Friday afternoon? We can be available anytime
after 12:30 on Friday if that works for you. Let us know.

Chris & Kyle

Hi Brenda,

It does sound like the weather may be bad tomorrow. We'll see what it
actually ends up doing and hear what you would like to do then. If it's bad
we can reschedule for later in the week if that works for you.

Regards,

Chris & Kyle

Hi,
Let's say 3:30pm Tuesday. I believe they are still calling for bad weather
so let's check in around noon or early afternoon tomorrow to confirm.
Thanks,
Brenda

Hi Brenda,

Meeting for this part of the development would be great. It can be difficult
to get a good understanding of it all just by looking at the mock-ups.

Would Tuesday work for you? We can meet anytime after 3:30pm on Tuesday if
that's good for you. Let us know.

Regards,

Chris & Kyle

Hi Chris and Kyle, I am sorry for not providing you with feedback earlier.
I think I am going to have to sit down with you to go through it, if that is
OK with you. I am having a hard time visualizing it live.
What does your schedule look like for next week...I understand there may be
snow on Monday so I don't want to travel in that.
My main concern is not to hold you up so let me know what day works for you.
Thanks,
Brenda

Hi Brenda,

We have put together some site mock-ups with places for the items that you
sent us today as well. Let us know what you think and any changes that you
would like to see.

Thanks,

Chris & Kyle

Hi guys!
I am attaching some nutritional information that I thought we could find a
place for(?) Also some cooking guidelines that maybe could go in the Recipe
/Cooking Lamb section. I have also attached (a very poor quality) Nova
Scotia Lamb Cut poster. I am trying to find a higher quality digital copy
but in the meantime, I wanted to make sure we have a spot for it.
Some links I would like to have included are: cansheep.ca, nssheep.ca,
nfacc.ca/codes-of-practice/sheep More to come.
Thanks,
Brenda

Hi Brenda,

We are putting together some design mock-ups for the site. If you would
like, we can meet in person sometime next week or we can send you the
mock-ups via email. Either way, you can let us know what you think and what
changes you may like to see. Just let us know what method of contact you
would like to use for this part of the project.

Chris & Kyle

Hi Chris and Kyle, It looks really great. I have signed off with my
electronic signature. I have some other material to get off to you and will
try to do that before the first of next week.
Thanks,
Brenda

Hi Brenda,

We have some documentation for you to look over and let us know if you
approve of everything we have so far. Let us know if there are any changes
you would like or any questions you might have. If you could provide us with
email confirmation after reviewing the attached document then we can move
forward with development of the design.

Regards,

Chris & Kyle
