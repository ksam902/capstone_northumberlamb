Hi Guys,,
I realized that the color would be an issue so I have asked for her to send
me it in different colors so that we can use the appropriate one depending
on the background.  I have had a terrible time getting a quick response from
this person but I will go back to her today to see when I might get the
different color logos.  If we don't get anything in the next day or so,  we
will use what you already have.
Friday afternoon works for me and Michael Isenor will be attending as well.
He is our Manager.  Is 3pm ok for you?
Sorry for not getting back to you sooner.  I wasn't around all last week due
to a family situation.
Brenda

Hi Brenda,

We should be able to work with that logo and the carcass chart. The only
thing with the logo that may be conflicting is where the "Lamb" is blue.
That will blend in with the background of the page. So we will either have
to change the background that it will go on or the "Lamb" will have to be
white or another colour so it can be seen.

Would you be able to meet on Friday for a final meeting to go over the site
and training for it?

Chris & Kyle

Hi Chris,  Sorry for the delay.  Here is the carcass chart.  Also,  I have
attached a new logo (it is still work in progress, but we can use this one
for now.  I will get back to you right away about the training and unveiling
date.  Thank you for your patience.

Hi Brenda,

We have added some more content to the site and are continuing to do so. We
have the new font implemented, size and placement will just have to be
tweaked a bit. The lamb grading chart is there, we just need to finish
populating it along with the other charts. There are buttons for the other
charts on the recipes page.

Have you had any luck with getting a lamb carcass image? That is probably
our biggest hold up right now.

We just have a couple of weeks left to go. We should look at setting up a
final meeting for late next week for unveiling and training of the site.
Would you be available late next week to meet?

Chris & Kyle

any questions.
Have a great weekend.

Hi Brenda,

We should be able to take care of the fonts. We will just have to look into
adding some further customization. Adding a notes field to the membership
application shouldn't be a problem at all.

We will send you an email the first of the week with updates and changes
that we have made to the site.

Hi guys,  I just noticed that on the membership application,  I asked the
producer to add a note with some specific information but I forgot to get
you to add a space where they could type in the info.  Can this be done?

Hi Brenda,

The application form looks good. We will get that up on the site.

When would be a good time to meet this week? We are available pretty well
every day but Thursday.

Hi Chris, Hope you and Kyle are enjoying your "snowy" March break.
I have attached an application for the producer section of the site. It has
a link on there as well.
Talk to you next week when you return. We will need to get together.

Hi Brenda,

Not sure if you got my last email or not. It appears I have two different
addresses for you. When I last replied it sent to
brenda.stewart@seaside.ns.ca. Is this email address the one that you use or
is the brenda.stewart@seasidehighspeed.com the one that you use?

The last email I sent should appear right below this one. I mentioned that
we can make another section for the About Us and Directors content to get it
off the home page. With doing that though, the home page will look kind of
bare. Is there any other content that you would like to be displayed on the
home page?

Hi Brenda,

We can definitely change it up. We can add another page to include the About
Us and Directors info.

Is there any other content that you would like to be displayed on the home
page? If we take those parts out and place them elsewhere, the home page may
end up looking a little bare.

Hi Chris, This helps me to visualize the site much better. Thank you. I
thought perhaps I wasn't understanding what the home page would look like
when you first sent me the pages a couple weeks ago; but now I see that the
homepage is designed to have the "About Us" and the Directors etc appear as
soon as someone goes to our site. Is it possible to have that information
set up as a separate page that the guest can click on if they are interested
in our history, directors etc.? I think that information is nice to have but
not the main focus.
I hope this isn't a problem.
Please let me know.
Brenda

Hi Brenda,

We have a live demo of the site for you to view. Not all of the features
have been implemented yet. The basic design is there though. We plan to have
more features completed next week. This is mainly to give you a rough idea
of how the site will look. It is important to note that all content on the
site is dynamically populated based on the administrator's input in the back
end.

The content is just mainly dummy content for now until we get the design a
bit more finalized. So none of the resources that you have sent along are
implemented as of yet.

Let us know what you think so far.

Looking forward to seeing the live demo. I have been having trouble finding
an electronic copy of a lamb carcass pic. We need it so you and Kyle can use
it for the various cuts of meat.

Hi Brenda,

I see the lamb grading chart there. We have been working on the site and we
should have a live demo online to show you tomorrow. Not all the features
will be implemented but it will give you a feel of how the real site will
look. We will send you an email tomorrow with a link to view it and you can
let us know what you think so far.

Hi Brenda,

We can meet with you either tomorrow (Thursday) or Monday the 12th. Anytime
in the late afternoon on either of those days is good with us. Let us know
if either of those dates will work for you and at what time. Once we get a
time that works for you we will book a room to meet at.

Hi Chris, The Directors of NorthumberLamb sincerely appreciate this
opportunity and I look forward to working with you and Kyle. I live just
outside of Halifax and work from home so later afternoon is the best time
for me to meet with you in Truro; although I don't want to inconvenience
you. What is the latest reasonable time for you and Kyle? Is there one day
of the week that works best for you?
Once I hear back, we can confirm a day and time.
My cell number is 902-233-8035, if you need to call for any reason.
Looking forward to meeting you and Kyle.
Brenda

Hello Brenda,



We appreciate you giving us the opportunity to work with you in developing a
full CMS website for your business.



To begin, we would like to meet with you to see what your requirements are
for this project. We are quite flexible with when we can meet and can work
around your schedule. Could you please provide us with a time that best
works for you. We should aim to meet within the next week if possible. We
have an office available here at the NSCC Truro campus we can use or we can
come to you if you would like.



We look forward to working with you!



Chris Borden & Kyle Samson
