        <div>
            <p>I hereby apply for membership in Northumberland Lamb Marketing Co-operative Ltd. I agree
            to abide by the Constitution and By-Laws of the Association, and to act at all times in a
            manner supportive to the Association.</p><br/>
            <p>I understand that, to remain a member in good standing, I will be expected to offer my lambs
            to NorthumberLamb before selling them to other buyers, although this does not apply to the
            sale of “freezer lambs” directly to retail customers.</p><br/>
            <p>Membership applications are approved by the Board of Directors. Applicants must have
            shipped lambs for at least one year. The quality of the lamb shipped, the shipper’s
            cooperativeness and dependability are all factors considered by the Board when reviewing
            the application.</p><br/>
            <p>A note outlining your flock size, lambing practices (in or out-of-season lambing), and the
            number of lambs we might expect to receive from you will help the Board in the review of the
            application.</p><br/>
